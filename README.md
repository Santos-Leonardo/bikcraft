Bikcraft

For this project, I was responsible for implementing the entire website based on an existing UI design. The platform was built for a local small business in handcrafted bikes and offering insurance services. My role was to translate the design into a smooth, clean, and fully functional website. This is a fictional company, though the project is real.
